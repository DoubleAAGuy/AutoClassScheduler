General tips for my hosting.
1. insert teachers on teachers page (use id not name) (You can set the class size limits too)
2. Same thing with students
3. Go to run page I recommend like 1000 loops and wait leaving the tab open.
4. When its done you can go to the download page and download the outputs. I recommend the 3rd one for the easiest.
5. Thats about it
